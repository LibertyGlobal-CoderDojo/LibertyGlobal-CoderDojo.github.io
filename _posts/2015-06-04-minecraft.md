[Minecraft][minecraft] is a great platform to make learning programming fun and with the [ScriptCraft][scriptcraft] plugin it becomes even more accessible.

To quote the [ScriptCraft][scriptcraft] website:

> ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Mod that lets you extend Minecraft using the Javascript Programming Language. ScriptCraft makes modding Minecraft easier. It includes a logo-like "Drone" object that can be used to build complex buildings, roads, villages, even entire cities. It also includes many other features that make modding Minecraft easier.

### Our public server

To support this we are currently maintaining a public [Minecraft][minecraft] server with the [ScriptCraft][scriptcraft] plugin already installed.

- The public server is located at `167.114.156.184:25667`
  - This is a 2GB instance supporting 40 players at [Shockbyte][shockbyte]
- In order run javascript you will need to be an `op`
  - To get `opped` ask at one of our Dojos, drop a comment on this post or request through the [forum][forum]
  - If necessary you will need to introduce yourself so we know who you are and then we'll need your public [Minecraft][minecraft] player name
- In order to upload scripts to the server you will need FTP access
  - To get this you will need to provide your email address so that a multicraft account can be requested for you at [Shockbyte][shockbyte]
  - Note that this may take a little time

### Running your own server locally

If you want to set up your own server locally to run [ScriptCraft][scriptcraft] you can follow these steps

#### Windows

1. Download and install [Java 1.8][java] (actually any version > 1.6 should work)

1. Create a CanaryMod folder in the root of the C: drive

    ```
    C:\CanaryMod
    ```
1. Download the [CanaryMod 1.2.0 jar file](canarymod) and put it in the `C:\CanaryMod` folder
  - We use CanaryMod instead of a vanilla Minecraft server as it facilitates plugins such as ScriptCraft. As a side note it's also possible to use other modded servers such as [Spigot][spigot] but to get started [CanaryMod][canarymod] is much simpler!
1. To allow the server to start on the first try create a `C:\CanaryMod\eula.txt` file with the following content (otherwise it will ask you to edit this file and accept the eula)

    ```
    eula=true
    ```
1. Create a `C:\CanaryMod\start.bat` file with the following content

    ```
    java -jar CanaryMod-1.2.0.jar
    pause
    ```
  - I find it nicer to run this without the GUI in case errors occur during initialization (eg. with bad config) - it's still possible to directly enter commands in the server's console.
  - If you do want to use the GUI then just remove the "java -jar" part from the front of the command or even skip the start.bat file and double click the jar file directly to start the server
1. Start the server for the first time by double clicking `C:\CanaryMod\start.bat`
  - This is needed in order to create the initial configuration folders, etc.
1. Stop the server by pressing `Ctrl-c` at the server console prompt
1. Download the [ScriptCraft jar file][scriptcraft-jar] to the `C:\CanaryMod\plugins` folder
  - At this point you can start the server again but you may want to make the following additional configuration changes first
1. Change or add the following configuration options in `C:\CanaryMod\config\worlds\default\default_NORMAL.cfg`

    ```
    ; completely flat worlds are best for building from scratch world-type=FLAT generate-structures=false
    
    ; creative mode
    gamemode=0
    pvp=false
    
    ; turns off authentication
    online-mode=false
    spawn-npcs=false
    spawn-monsters=false
    ```
1. Add yourself to the list of ops (only ops can run javascript by default) by adding your player name to `C:\CanaryMod\config\ops.cfg`
1. Delete the existing world that was generated on first start so that a new flat world is generated by removing the `C:\CanaryMod\worlds` folder (this is also a good way to reset a world)
1. Start the server again by double clicking `C:\CanaryMod\start.bat`
1. Connect using a Minecraft 1.8 client - use the add server option to add a server with Server Address set to localhost
  - NB. If using an earlier version of Minecraft you may need an earlier version of CanaryMod too
